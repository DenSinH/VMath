# VMath
A wrapper for intel SSE/AVX vector instructions

This is just a toy thing to figure out what working with intrinsics is like. 
I tried to keep it kinda short, which was possible with some defines and templating.
Right now only basic operations are implemented (as far as possible),
so no strange other AVX/SSE functions.
